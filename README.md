# 🧠 Prompting for Effective LLM Reasoning – Smart Policy Advisor

This project demonstrates how to build a structured LLM reasoning pipeline to simulate expert decision-making for livestock policy design in rural Ethiopia. It's designed as a capstone-style project for Udacity's **"Prompting for Effective LLM Reasoning"** course.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Create a multi-step reasoning system using prompt engineering techniques (chain-of-thought, few-shot examples, structured output) to:
- Understand rural livestock challenges (e.g., goat market volatility in Gursum)
- Recommend policy interventions based on context
- Analyze risks and feasibility of each proposed policy
